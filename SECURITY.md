# Security

## Scope

This repository contains one bounded Intelligent Contract, direct tests, a five-validator GLSim test, and an opt-in StudioNet smoke test. It has no frontend, backend, database, token, payout, proxy upgrade, or repository secret.

## Trust model

Untrusted evidence is delimited as data, model outputs use closed schemas, and validator replay must agree before semantic state is stored.

The deployer is the host and may also be the left entrant; left and right entrant addresses are fixed, and a different named judge records the final decision.

## Implemented controls

- Concrete immutable GenVM runner hash; no floating runner dependency.
- Address normalization, explicit role separation, collection caps, one-time actions, and lifecycle locks.
- Bounded text plus strict `[EXPECTED]` and `[LLM_ERROR]` failure classes.
- Sorted, delimited evidence packets and independent validator replay.
- Storage is copied before nondeterministic callbacks; static audit requires zero callback reads from `self`.
- No cross-contract calls, fund custody, transfer, automated purchase, external deletion, or webhook.
- `.env`, caches, artifacts, wallet files, and local secrets are ignored. Live wallets are encrypted outside the workspace.

## Contract-specific safety properties

- Criteria freeze before either entry can be compared.
- Only the designated entrant can submit its assigned side.
- Each entrant may lodge at most one bounded objection after comparison.
- AI cannot select the final winner; only the distinct human judge can do so.

## Residual risks

- The contract compares text declarations and does not inspect photographs.
- Time, place, authorship, and provenance declarations are recorded but not authenticated.
- The comparison is challenge-specific and is not a general artistic-quality score.

Do not use this contract to make legal, medical, financial, employment, admission, credit, or physical-safety decisions beyond the explicit low-risk policy in its source. A new use case requires a fresh deployment and independent domain review.

## Reporting

Report vulnerabilities privately to the repository owner with the contract name, affected method, reproduction, expected invariant, and impact. Never include private keys, wallet passwords, or personal data.
